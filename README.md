# EDA-project-1
studying various dataset types
Zomato Data EDA & Feature Engineering
📘 Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering on the Zomato dataset to uncover insights about restaurants, ratings, cuisines, and geographical distribution.
The aim is to understand customer preferences and prepare data for further machine learning or business intelligence tasks.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess the raw dataset

Explore hidden patterns, correlations, and outliers

Engineer meaningful features for future modeling

Visualize key insights about restaurants and customer behavior

🧩 Key Steps

Data Cleaning

Handling missing values

Removing duplicates

Fixing inconsistent data (like country codes, currency, etc.)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate and bivariate analysis

Visualizing distributions (ratings, votes, cost, cuisines)

Country-wise and city-wise restaurant analysis

Understanding delivery, dining, and online ordering trends

Feature Engineering

Encoding categorical variables

Creating new features (e.g., average cost per two, country mapping)

Scaling and transforming data for modeling

Visualization Tools

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Plotly (optional for interactive visuals)

📊 Insights Extracted

Top cuisines and countries contributing to Zomato’s global presence

Relationship between price range, ratings, and customer votes
